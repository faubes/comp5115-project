\frametitle{Conclusion}
Project needs to be refocused: even if Fusion algorithm run successful,
not clear how to improve or modify.

Possible ideas:
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyze depth measurements in ``.ply'' files produced by camera. Perhaps
a higher quality point cloud can be obtained by blending several ``'identical''
frames together.
\item Applied project which describes the entire geometry pipeline, from
scanning and registration to 3d printing.
\end{itemize}
