\section{Methodology}
Specifically, this report includes:

 \begin{itemize}
   \item a quick look at the stereoscopic depth camera's inner workings,
   \item the use of the RealSense SDK and Viewer to produce point clouds,
   \item the use of MeshLab's registration (or align) methods to merge point clouds,
   \item a survey of some techniques available for smoothing, eliminating noise, and
   \item reconstructing a mesh from the merged point clouds.
 \end{itemize}
