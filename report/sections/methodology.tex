\section{Methodology}
After taking a quick look at the stereoscopic depth camera's inner workings, this
report details the capturing and aligning of point clouds for model reconstruction.
This process consists of a few steps:

 \begin{itemize}
   \item the use of the RealSense SDK and Viewer to produce depth images and point clouds \cite{librealsense},
   \item the use of MeshLab's registration (or align) methods to merge point clouds,
   \item a survey of some techniques available for smoothing, eliminating noise, and
   \item reconstructing a mesh from the merged point clouds.
 \end{itemize}
